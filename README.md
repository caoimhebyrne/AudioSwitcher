## AudioSwitcher

AudioSwitcher is a mod for 1.8.9 and 1.12.2 which allows you to switch audio output devices inside of Minecraft

## Installation

1. Download the latest version for your version from
   the [releases page](https://github.com/cbyrneee/AudioSwitcher/releases)
2. Open your ``.minecraft/mods`` folder and drag the .jar file into it

## Incompatibilities
- macOS does not expose sound devices to LWJGL correctly, especially if running under Rosetta. The current sound device is only returned, meaning that AudioSwitcher will not work on macOS.
